Ever found yourself handling files manually and thinking, "This is fine for now, but what if I could automate it and save time in the long run?"

That’s exactly the thought that pushed me to build a simple File Management System in Python. Right now, it might seem like just a small utility—listing directories, renaming files, deleting paths—but this is just the foundation.

𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝒃𝒊𝒈𝒈𝒆𝒓 𝒗𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏? 
Imagine integrating advanced features like bulk file operations, automated backups, version control, or even cloud storage integration. That’s where this project can be extended. A tool that doesn’t just save a few clicks but becomes a true time-saver for handling large-scale file management tasks.

🏗️ First Approach: The If-Else Way
The initial version of the script was straightforward:
✅ List directory contents
✅ Rename a file
✅ Delete a file or directory
✅ Create a new directory

It worked by using a menu-driven system, where the user inputs a choice, and the corresponding function executes. 

This worked well but had a drawback: too many if-elif conditions made the code look cluttered.

That’s when I decided to refactor it using dictionary dispatch.

🔥 The Dictionary Dispatch Approach – Cleaner & More Pythonic
Instead of chaining if-elif conditions, we can map user choices directly to functions using a dictionary. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

menu_options = {
 "1": list_directory_content,
 "2": rename_file,
 "3": delete_path,
 "4": create_directory,
 "5": exit_program
} 
Now, handling user input becomes just one line:
menu_options.get(choice, invalid_choice)()

If the user enters an invalid choice, the fallback function invalid_choice() gets called.

🚀 What Changed?
✅ More readable – No more long if-elif chains.
✅ Easier to extend – Just add new functions to the dictionary.
✅ Efficient execution – Direct function calls reduce unnecessary comparisons.

And the best part? Exiting the program is now more elegant:
def exit_program():
 print("Exiting......")
 return "exit"

We simply check if exit_program() returns "exit", and then break the loop:

if menu_options.get(choice, invalid_choice)() == "exit":
 break

This removes the need for a hardcoded break inside the function.

✨ Key Takeaways
🔹 If-Else Approach – Good for small programs but can get messy with too many conditions.
🔹 Dictionary Dispatch – More Pythonic, scalable, and easier to maintain.
🔹 Efficient Menu Handling – Using menu_options.get(choice, invalid_choice)() simplifies function execution.
🔹 Clean Exit Handling – Returning "exit" makes breaking the loop more structured.
